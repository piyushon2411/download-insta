Instagram Profile Downloader
This Python script downloads all posts from a specified Instagram profile using the instaloader library.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed

instaloader Python library installed. You can install it via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install instaloader
Usage
Open the download_instagram_profile.py script in a text editor.

Replace "instagram_username" in the line username = "instagram_username" with the username of the Instagram profile you want to download posts from.

Save the changes and run the script:

bash
Copy code
python download_instagram_profile.py
This will download all posts, including images and videos, from the specified Instagram profile to a folder named after the profile's username.

If the script fails to download a post, it will skip it and try to download the remaining posts. The URLs of the posts that failed to download will be saved to a text file named <username>_failed_posts.txt in the current directory, where <username> is the Instagram profile's username.
